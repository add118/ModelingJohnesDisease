This is an instruction file for creating branches. The branches I'll be using
for examples are:

staging_alex : This will be branched off of the 'staging' branch
staging : This was branched off of the 'master' branch

The goal is to create a new branch called 'staging_alex' from existing branch
'staging'. The following is an example. DO NOT USE THESE COMMANDS EXACTLY:

git checkout staging
git checkout -b staging_alex
git push origin staging_alex:staging_alex

The branch should now show up on github. It's ideal to keep local work in your
own staging branch and then once work is finished to merge with the main
staging branch. Only when a delivarable is due should the staging branch be
merged with master.
