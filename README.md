# Modeling Johnes Disease
##AnyLogic Model of Johne's Disease in beef cattle.
Initially this project will focus on creating an accurate agent based model of Johnes Disease in beef cattle, with a focus later on modeling possible diagnosis senarios to help lower the prevelance of the disease in a population.
